# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
CS-250

1.	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The process of interpreting the user's needs begins by understanding the client's goals and breaking them down into actionable tasks. I used User Stories to translate customer requirements into clear, concise deliverables. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, the feature of customer registration was necessary. A User Story defined what was expected from that feature: specific acceptance criteria included that email and password fields were required. This helped the development team to understand the functionality, reducing ambiguity and thus implementing the feature effectively within a sprint.

User stories provide clarity and structure, putting the focus on the end user, making it easier to prioritize tasks for the teams and keep them aligned with the product vision. They also help in fostering collaboration, as they act like common references among the developers, testers, and Product Owners.

2.	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development iteratively, following Agile principles to ensure flexibility and adaptability. For the SNHU Travel project, features like the itinerary builder were developed incrementally. Developers collaborated closely with testers to identify and resolve bugs within the same sprint, ensuring high-quality deliverables. Agile processes such as Sprint Planning and Daily Stand-ups were crucial in aligning team efforts and maintaining progress.

In future projects, I hope to incorporate processes such as continuous integration and iterative testing to ensure quality and adaptability. Additionally, Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives will remain central to my workflow, as they allow for client feedback and continuous improvement, ensuring the final product meets or exceeds expectations.

3.	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member prioritizes effective communication, collaboration, and accountability. In resolving some blockers at SNHU Travel, such as ambiguous Acceptance Criteria, active participation was required along with teamwork to resolve them. For example, when the requirements about an itinerary builder were vague, I worked with the Product Owner and developers to refine the criteria for seamless progress.

Being a good team player involves being open to feedback as well as contributing to the well-being of the team dynamic. I supported the culture for trust and shared responsibility by the active participation in Stand-ups and fostering open communication. In a nutshell, effective teamwork is tapping into the strengths of people and working together to make the desired outcomes.
